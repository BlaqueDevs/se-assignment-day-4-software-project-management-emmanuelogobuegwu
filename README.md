# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
Question: How does managing costs help a project succeed? How can budget overruns be avoided?
Answer: Keeping costs under control makes sure the project stays on track and doesn’t run out of money before it’s finished. To avoid going over budget, plan carefully, keep an eye on expenses, and focus on the most important features first.

Question: What’s the difference between Agile and Waterfall?
Answer:

Agile is flexible—you can make changes as you go, which is great for evolving projects like apps. But it requires constant teamwork and communication.

Waterfall follows a step-by-step plan, which works well for projects with clear requirements, like government or banking software. However, making changes later can be tough.

Question: When is Agile better than Waterfall, and vice versa?
Answer:

Agile is better for fast-moving projects where requirements might change, like startups or mobile apps.

Waterfall is best when you need a clear structure and minimal changes, like in healthcare or financial software.

Question: How do you make sure software quality stays high? Why is it important?
Answer: Test the software regularly, review the code, and get user feedback. High-quality software means fewer bugs, happier users, and less stress down the road.

Question: Why is defining the project scope important? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
Answer: Defining the scope helps avoid confusion and extra work. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) simply breaks the project into smaller, manageable tasks so it’s easier to track progress.

Question: Why is having a project schedule helpful? How do Gantt charts help?
Answer: A schedule keeps the team organized and on track. A Gantt chart is a visual timeline that shows what needs to be done and when, making it easier to manage deadlines.

Question: What problem does your software solve, and why does it matter?
Answer: Your software solves a specific problem—maybe it makes security easier or automates boring tasks. This matters because it saves people time, effort, and money.

Question: Why is defining the problem clearly important for software development?
Answer: A well-defined problem leads to a better solution. If you’re not clear on what you’re fixing, you might end up building the wrong thing.

Question: How would you describe your software without using technical jargon?
Answer: It’s a simple tool that helps with [problem] by [how it helps]—so you don’t have to worry about it.

Question: What makes your software unique?
Answer: It has [key features] that make it stand out from the competition.

Question: How big is the market for your software?
Answer: Check industry reports and competitors to see how many people need a solution like yours.

Question: Why should you pay attention to market trends?
Answer: Trends show what people are looking for, so you can build something they actually want and stay ahead of the competition.
